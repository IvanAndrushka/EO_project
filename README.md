Classification of fields in satellite images

The main file is the Satellite_image_classification.ipynb notebook.
The train_model.ipynb notebook is used to train the MobileNetV2 CNN with a small sample of data from the Functional Map of the World dataset.
The sat_classifier.model file is the trained model with the images in the fmow_rgb folder.
The folder gee_image_downloads is an auxiliary folder that stores rgb images that are used for the classification.

Here is an example using an image of the city I live in :)
